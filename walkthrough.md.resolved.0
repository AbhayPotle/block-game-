# Hand-Controlled Block Game Walkthrough

## Overview
You have successfully created a "Block Game" that you can control with hand gestures! The game uses your webcam to track your hand movements and translates them into game controls.

## How to Run
1. Ensure your webcam is connected.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls
The game screen will show the Block Game on the left and your camera feed on the right.

- **Move Left**: Move your hand to the **LEFT** side of the camera frame (your left).
- **Move Right**: Move your hand to the **RIGHT** side of the camera frame.
- **Rotate Block**: **PINCH** your index finger and thumb together.
- **Move Down**: Gravity moves the block down automatically.

## Debugging
- If the game runs slow, ensure good lighting for the camera so MediaPipe can track your hand faster.
- If controls feel reversed, remember the camera image is mirrored for natural interaction (moving your hand right moves the cursor right).
